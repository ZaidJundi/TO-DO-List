# TODO-LIST Application

A simple and user-friendly TODO-LIST application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to create, manage, and keep track of their tasks efficiently. The tasks are stored locally using the browser's Local Storage, so no database is required.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a single click.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list once they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Persistent Data**: All tasks are stored in the browser's Local Storage, ensuring that your list remains even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Task**: Type your task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
2. **Manage Tasks**: Click on a task to mark it as complete. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
3. **Persistent Storage**: The tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage, allowing them to persist even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.
